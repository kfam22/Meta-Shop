        <p>Circularity, for us is the ability to recycle, and to “regenerate” materials that already exist, defining our Modus Operandi in reducing waste by reintegrating the end-of-life products into a cyclical process that ensure transparency and adaptability of our resources.

        Upcycled and recycled materials are at the center of our design process. Today, around 50% of our collections are composed of upcycled products. The other half sees us working with innovative and sustainable fibers, such as biodegradable yarns and recycled fibers.
